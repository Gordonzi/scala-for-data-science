# Scala for Data Science

These notebooks and other material are for the Scala Days 2016 and Strata London 2016 talks by Andy Petrella and Dean Wampler on why Scala is a great language for Data Science.

The talk is organized as a series of notebooks, install [Spark Notebook](http://spark-notebook.io/), then run it with the following command, where we assume that `$SPARK_NOTEBOOK_HOME` is where you installed it and `$PWD` is this directory:

```shell
$SPARK_NOTEBOOK_HOME/bin/spark-notebook -Dmanager.notebooks.dir=$PWD/notebooks
```
